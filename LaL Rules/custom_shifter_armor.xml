      <notes>This special armor is made specifically for shifters out of YNT Softweave, and is designed to be useable in both their animal and metahuman forms. The armor is made to adjust as they shift to accomodate their shape. Because of this, it does not work for mages using the Shapeshift spell, as they simply 'pop' into their new form instead of morphing into it.</notes>
